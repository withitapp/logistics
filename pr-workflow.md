## Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a topic branch ex: `edit-users-view`.

2. Create a github pull request for that branch even before you commit anything to that branch.

3. In this pull request, clearly explain what changes you want to implement in you topic branch.

4. Discuss and improve this proposal or the way you will implement that feature, with that repo's active contributors.

5. Once you and everyone agrees and know what this branch is about, do work in your topic branch.

6. When you think branch is ready merging back to the master, post an head-up to the pull request you have created earlier and ask for code reviews.

7. Once the majority of the contributers 'LGTM' (Looks good to me) the pull request, you can safely merge back you branch.
